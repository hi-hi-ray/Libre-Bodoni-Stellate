# Libre Bodoni: Stellate
You can check the project over [behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/151311579/Libre-Bodoni-Stellate/modules/854399793) page.

Libre Bodoni Stellate is a font designed to be a Classy but Fun Letter Type Title, based on the Libre Bodoni Project Font typeface.

The Libre Bodoni Stellate brings the feeling of elegance and style that only The Libre Bodoni fonts has. In the Stellate every letter and number has a petit star, to break the serious tone, but maintaining the class. Have fun combining this Font with Regular Bodoni in the same title or also creating a full title.
